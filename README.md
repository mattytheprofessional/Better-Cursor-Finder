# Better Cursor Finder

**Better Cursor Finder** is an enhanced and modernized implementation of the native Windows “Find My Cursor” feature. While Windows provides a basic visual locator animation, this project rethinks the experience with improved visibility, smoother rendering, and a more practical on-screen presence.

The objective is simple: make the mouse pointer instantly visible under any condition — multi-monitor setups, high-resolution displays, dark interfaces, bright environments, or fast-paced workflows — without disrupting productivity.

## Why Better Cursor Finder?

The default Windows cursor locator is functional but limited. It lacks customization, visual clarity under certain backgrounds, and does not always feel responsive enough in real-world usage.

Better Cursor Finder improves this by providing:

- A clearer and more visible overlay effect  
- Smoother animation behavior  
- Stronger contrast and visual focus  
- Reliable performance across different resolutions and DPI scaling settings  
- Lightweight background execution with minimal system impact  

The application remains unobtrusive while being instantly accessible when needed.
